I have a requirement for the development of a Python 2.7 based IT security tool that has the functionality of the scripts listed in this project description.


You must include the functionality of the following scripts

1. Basic Recon

2. Google/Bing Dork Attack Functionality

Tool specifics - 
 
The tool that you will be developing must have the functionality of all of python scripts listed above.


Take all of the scripts' functionality and create a class for each core competency.

Classes:
- recon
- dork
- dnsenum
- dir_admin
- lb_waf


Be sure to give credit to original scripts that you use for reference in your source code.


Example tool usage (note doesn't have to be exact - this is just an example):

python toolname.py -r <domain_name>
		--recon <domain_name>
					
python toolname.py -e <domain_name>
		--dnsenum <domain_name>
										
python toolname.py -l <domain_name>
		--lbwaf <domain_name>

 
Lastly, the script needs to be modular and allow for new functionality to be added easily.
